## Revolutionise the way you search and build your own Streamlit AI search application Cohere’s large language models. Follow the steps in the article using and the GitHub repository provided and the 5 steps outlined in this article.

## Introduction

In recent years, natural language processing (NLP) has rapidly advanced, thanks to the latest generation of large language models. However, not all developers are able to use these models due to the high compute barriers and the lack of technical expertise required to do so. This is where Cohere comes in.

Cohere provide access to large language models that can be used to generate or analyse text to do things like write copy, moderate content, classify data and extract information, all at a massive scale. Cohere offer a generous free developer tier, meaning you can build and test your ideas quickly and with no cost.

## What is Cofinder?

In this article, I will introduce Cofinder, a semantic search application built using Cohere’s technology. [This was an entry for my first hackathon](https://lablab.ai/event/semantic-search-hackathon/cofinder/cofinder) with [Lablab.ai](https://lablab.ai/event), I would recommend hackathons to anyone that wants to learn and push themselves in the space of AI.

> Cofinder is designed to help the Cohere Community find relevant content in one place based on their personal goals. With Cofinder, users can ask natural language questions, and the tool will provide the most relevant content, aim to answer their questions, and provide context.

Its inspiration comes from Cohere’s mission to give technology language and to put large language models into more hands. However, there are two main barriers to achieving this goal: a compute barrier and a lack of knowledge among developers.

Cofinder is the result of my desire to make it easier for the Cohere community to access the wealth of knowledge and resources available on the platform. While Cohere provides an incredible variety of resources, such as product explanations, tutorials, open repositories, and a Discord channel, I recognised that finding specific information can still be time-consuming and inefficient. By creating a semantic search tool that brings together information from multiple sources, Cofinder aims to streamline the process and save users valuable time. The goal is to enhance the Cohere community experience by making it easy for developers, entrepreneurs, corporations, and data scientists to find what they need in one place.

Let’s build our own semantic search application to enhance search!

Cofinder | [Streamlit](https://ellenealds-coheresemanticsearchtool-main-8phb6k.streamlit.app/) demo

In the following sections, I will go through the 5 stages of building your application: pre-processing your data sources, creating a search index, building your Streamlit front end, adding your search and answer functions.

I will also provide a repository and explanations of the code snippets to help you follow along and build your own semantic search application.

But before we dive into the technical details, let’s take a closer look at the Cohere products we used in building Cofinder. We will use Cofinder to learn more about each product.

## Cohere’s Embedding and Generate Models: The Key to Cofinder’s Semantic Search

Cofinder uses two of Cohere’s products, co.embed and co.generate, to power its semantic search functionality. co.embed is a language model that generates vector representations of text, which can be used for various natural language processing (NLP) tasks such as clustering and classification. In Cofinder, co.embed is used to generate vector embeddings for the articles that users can search.

co.generate is a language model that generates text based on the given prompt. In Cofinder, co.generate is used to formulate an answer to the user’s question using the context from the search and the question itself. By leveraging these powerful NLP models, Cofinder is able to provide accurate and relevant search results to users, making it easier and more efficient to find information on Cohere

Let’s check out [Cofinder](https://ellenealds-coheresemanticsearchtool-main-8phb6k.streamlit.app/) to help find relevant Cohere resources.

**Question:** What are embeddings?

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/1*H2mHffEELdxUDHHS4mv-8Q.png)

Cofinder | What are embeddings?

**Results:** As Cofinder quickly provides the user with content from across multiple platforms. Each relevant document contains:

-   The category (video, blog, user and product documentation)
-   The content title
-   A answer generated using the search query and content as context
-   Link to the content

We now have a variety of content to watch and read to help understand what embeddings are and formulate a good solid understanding.

Cofinder | Search response

Once you have a better understanding of what embeddings are, you may now want to explore what you can do with embeddings, let’s ask Cofinder again.

**Question:** What can embeddings be used for?

This time, our content is more focused on possible use cases, each one gives us the opportunity to explore multiple areas in more depth.

Cofinder | Search results

## Let’s Start Building!

## **5 Steps to Build your own Semantic Search Application**

We can breakdown the process into 5 steps of development:

1.  **Data Sources:** pre-processing the article text into chunks.
2.  **Embeddings & Search Index:** use co.embed to obtain a vector representation of our data. Store your embeddings in a vector database which we will later use to search for relevant content.
3.  **Front End:** Streamlit for our user to interact with our search engine.
4.  **Search:** we use co.embed to get the vector representation of the user query, using nearest neighbours to return relevant content.
5.  **Answer:** use co.generate to answer the query given the context from the search results and the question.

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/1*W2a7CnJs_IyjqV7vP2_leQ.png)

Cofinder | Development Stages

## Github Repository

Here is a GitHub repository to follow along with the process:xxxx

**Repository Contents**

-   **requirements.txt:** contains the libraries needed for our application
-   **cohere\_text.csv:** text prior to pre-processing
-   **main.py:** this contains our code for the Streamlit app
-   **preprocessing.ipynb:** this contains our code for generating embeddings and preparing our search index using the cohere\_text.csv file

These files will be produced when you run **preprocessing.ipynb**

-   **cohere\_text\_final.csv:** text after pre-processing
-   **search\_index.ann:** a search index containing our embeddings

You will need your Cohere API key to continue with the development.

## Creating our Search Index

Our first three stages are to **pre-process the text** by splitting it into small chunks, we will then **generate embeddings** using co.embed and finally **create a search index** using Annoy. _This section of code can be found in preprocessing.ipynb_

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/1*LmQVJOhNwWOIcvxLFw7RRA.png)

[Semantic Search (cohere.ai)](https://docs.cohere.ai/docs/semantic-search)

## 1\. Data Sources — Pre-processing Text

The repository contains a csv file called cohere\_text\_preprocessing.csv with a row for each url, the title and the text taken from the webpage. Each item contains a category and type which is return in the search results.

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/1*st7DViVAFI62NB7un91Q_Q.png)

CSV File | cohere\_text\_preprocessing

_Note: Some of the information may be outdated as this text was extracted in October 2022 and is for demonstration purposes only._

After importing the csv file, we need to pre-process the text into chunks, the chunks will be used in a later stage as context where we want to generate an answer. As we will use co.generate for this task, we need to make sure our text chunks are no larger than 1500 words.

To maintain context, we will split the text chunks into 1500 and overlap the chunks using 500 tokens from the previous chunk relevant to the article.

```python
import textwrapdef chunk_text(df, width=1500, overlap=500):        
new_df = pd.DataFrame(columns=['id', 'text_chunk'])        
for index, row in df.iterrows():                
    chunks = []        for i in range(0, len(row['text']), width - overlap):            
    chunk = row['text'][i:i+width]            
    chunks.append(chunk)                
    for i, chunk in enumerate(chunks):                        
        start_index = i * (width - overlap)                                    
        new_row = {              'id': row['id'],               
        'text_chunk': chunk,               
        'start_index': start_index}            
        new_df = new_df.append(new_row, ignore_index=True)    
        return new_dfnew_df = chunk_text(df)
```

## 2a. get embeddings

We use the co.embed to obtain a vector representation of our data.

``` python
import cohere
import numpy as np
co = cohere.Client('<API_KEY>')
embeds = co.embed(texts=list(df['text_chunk']),                  
    model="large",                  
    truncate="RIGHT").embeddings
embeds = np.array(embeds)embeds.shape
```

Great! We now have our pre-processed text and embeddings ready for the next stage where we create a search index to store the data.

## 2b. Search Index

-   Step 3 — create a search index using Annoy

```python
from annoy import AnnoyIndex
search_index = AnnoyIndex(embeds.shape[1], 'angular')
for i in range(len(embeds)):    
    search_index.add_item(i, embeds[i])search_index.build(10) 
    search_index.save('search_index.ann')
```

The final three stages are to **create our Streamlit application,** we load the relevant libraries, data and search index from the previous stages. We then add functions to **generate embeddings to search** the Annoy index for the user’s query, and **generate an answer** from the context**.** This is all tied together in the Streamlit app with widgets for user input and markdown to display the results. _This section of code can be found in main.py_

## 3\. Front End — Streamlit

_In the main.py file,_ we build our code for the Streamlit application.

Here we import the libraries we need, the API key, initiate our cohere client and load the search index and csv file

```python
import streamlit as st
import cohere  
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from annoy import AnnoyIndex
from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor
import toml
with open('secret.toml') as f:    
    secrets = toml.load(f)
api_key = secrets['API_KEY']

co = cohere.Client('api_key')

search_index = AnnoyIndex(f=4096, metric='angular')
search_index.load('search_index.ann')
df = pd.read_csv('cohere_text_final.csv')

st.title("Cofinder")
st.subheader("A semantic search tool built for the Cohere community")
```

## 4\. Search Function

The `search` function takes in a query, the number of search results to return `n_results`, a dataframe `df`, an index `search_index`, and an embedding model `co.ebbed()`. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of what the function does:

1.  The function uses the `co.embed` function to get the embedding of the query using the specified model (`"large"`).
2.  The function uses the `search_index.get_nns_by_vector` function to get the `n_results` nearest neighbors to the query embedding in the specified index `search_index`. The function returns the indices of the nearest neighbors as well as the similarity scores.
3.  The function filters the original dataframe (`df`) to include only the rows that correspond to the nearest neighbors returned in step 2.
4.  The function adds two new columns to the filtered dataframe: `similarity`, which contains the similarity scores between the query embedding and the document embeddings; and `nearest_neighbors`, which contains the indices of the nearest neighbors.
5.  Finally, the function sorts the filtered dataframe by similarity in descending order and returns it.

The results of the search will be used as context to answer the user’s question.

```python
def search(query, n_results, df, search_index, co):        
    query_embed = co.embed(texts=[query],                    
    model="large",                    
    truncate="LEFT").embeddings                
    
    nearest_neighbors = search_index.get_nns_by_vector(        
        query_embed[0],         
        n_results,         
        include_distances=True)        
    
    df = df[df.index.isin(nearest_neighbors[0])]    
    df['similarity'] = nearest_neighbors[1]    
    index_similarity_df = pd.DataFrame({'similarity':nearest_neighbors[1]}, index=nearest_neighbors[0])
    df = df.join(index_similarity_df,) # Match similarities based on indexes
    df = df.sort_values(by='similarity', ascending=False)    
    return df
```

When we run this function, we get a JSON output containing the article title and the context relevant to the query

```

## 5\. Answer Function

We now want to take the user question and generate an answer to the question given the search results from the previous function.

Overall, the `display` function below is broken down into two tasks,

1.  The `gen_answer` and `gen_better_answer` functions are used to generate answers for the query and each of the search results. The `gen_answer` function generates an initial answer based on a prompt that includes the paragraph and the question, while `gen_better_answer` generates a better answer by incorporating the initial answers and the question.
2.  The results are displayed in a user-friendly format using the `st` module from the Streamlit library. The search query is displayed as a subheader, followed by the better answer generated by `gen_better_answer`. The relevant documents are then displayed, one by one. Each document is displayed with its type, category, title, and link, followed by the initial answer generated by `gen_answer`. The text of the document is then collapsed and can be expanded by clicking on "Read more".

```python
def display(query, results):            
    with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=1) as executor:        
        results['answer'] = list(executor.map(gen_answer,                                               
        [query]*len(results),                                              
        results['text']))    
        answers = results['answer'].tolist()        
        answ = gen_better_answer(query, answers)        
        st.subheader(query)    
        st.write(answ)        
        st.write('')    
        st.write('')    
        st.subheader("Relevant documents")        
        for i, row in results.iterrows():                
            st.markdown(f'**{row["Type"]}**')        
            st.markdown(f'**{row["Category"]}**')        
            st.markdown(f'{row["title"]}')                        
            st.markdown(f'[{row["link"]}]({row["link"]})')        
            st.write(row['answer'])                
            with st.expander('Read more'):            
                st.write(row['text'])        
                st.write('')
```

Let’s explore the the `gen_answer` and `gen_better_answer` functions to see what is happening.

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/1*3sUd3W4bgacWUd2AiLwIJA.png)

Cofinder | search context and generate best answer

Here we create two co.generate() prompts, these functions use Cohere’s pre-trained models to generate text that answers a given question from the context provided from the search results.

-   `gen_answer(q, para)`: This function returns an answer to the question given the context returned from our search function. In the display function above, we ran this function by iterating over each of the search results from the JSON output to gather context from multiple sources.
-   `gen_better_answer(ques, ans)`: This function takes the question and all of the responses from the`gen_answer` function, it uses the combined answers to formulate a more rounded answer taking into account all the available resources.

The `max_tokens` and `temperature` parameters can be tuned to control the length and randomness of the generated text.

```python
def gen_answer(q, para):     
    response = co.generate(         
        model='command-xlarge-20221108',         
        prompt=f'''Paragraph:{para}\n\n                
        Answer the question using this paragraph.\n\nQuestion: {q}\nAnswer:''',
        max_tokens=100,         
        temperature=0.4)    
        return response.generations[0].text
        
    def gen_better_answer(ques, ans):     
        response = co.generate(         
            model='command-xlarge-20221108',         
            prompt=f'''Answers:{ans}\n\nQuestion: {ques}\n\nGenerate a new answer that uses the best answers and makes reference to the question.''',         max_tokens=100,         
            temperature=0.4)            
            return response.generations[0].text
```

Finally, we add a streamlit search input along with some question examples for the user, and button that runs our functions.

```python
query = st.text_input('Ask a question about Cohere')
st.markdown('''Try some of these examples: - What is the Cohere API?- What are embeddings?- What is the Cohere playground?- How can I build a chatbot?''')
if st.button('Search'):    
    results = search(query, 3, df, search_index, co)    
    display(query, results)
```

Well done! You are now you are ready to [publish your Streamlit application to the cloud!](https://streamlit.io/cloud)
